# Launch Knowledge Modal

Salesforce Knowledge provides a great way of authoring and displaying a rich knowledge base of policies, standard operating procedures, FAQs and more. Sometimes, it's nice to have quick access to the content of those articles, directly from within you Lightning apps to help direct users to specific on-demand answers or training. This LWC allows you to tie a specific Knowledge article (by name) to a button you can display within the Lightning App Builder on app pages or record pages on desktop. The article is displayed a modal window. Multiple isntances of this LWC can be included on the same page, and using conditional visibility settings in the Lightning App Builder, can render only when needed at certain steps or stages in a process, when record details meet a certain criteria, or only for certain users based on profile.
